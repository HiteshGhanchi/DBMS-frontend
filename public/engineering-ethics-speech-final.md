# Engineering Ethics Presentation Script
## By Rehan Ansari and Hitesh Ghanchi

### Speaker 1 (Hitesh):
"Ethics is knowing the difference between what you have a right to do and what is right to do."

Good morning everyone. Today, my partner Rehan and I will be discussing Engineering Ethics and its crucial role in modern technology development.

Engineering ethics are the moral principles and professional norms that guide engineers in their decision-making. With rapid technological advancement, these ethical considerations have become more critical than ever. The National Society of Professional Engineers emphasizes that engineers must "hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public."

Let me illustrate this with the EpiPen Price Manipulation case from 2016. Mylan Pharmaceuticals increased the price of life-saving EpiPens from $100 to over $600 - a decision that directly impacted millions of people who depend on this device for survival. As engineers, this case particularly concerns us because of how engineering decisions were misused for profit.

Let's examine the ethical violations in detail:
1. Patent Manipulation:
   - Engineers made minor, unnecessary design changes
   - These changes weren't to improve the product but to extend patents
   - This blocked affordable generic alternatives from entering the market

2. Public Health Impact:
   - Many patients couldn't afford the inflated prices
   - Some resorted to using expired EpiPens
   - Others attempted dangerous alternatives

3. Engineering Integrity Compromise:
   - Engineers' skills were used to create barriers rather than innovations
   - The focus shifted from public safety to corporate profit
   - Technical decisions were driven by business strategy rather than user needs

How could this have been prevented?
- Implementing ethical oversight committees
- Establishing clear guidelines for patent modifications
- Creating channels for engineers to report ethical concerns
- Regular reviews of pricing impact on accessibility
- Mandatory public health impact assessments

I'll now hand over to my colleague Rehan to discuss another crucial case study and emerging challenges.

### Speaker 2 (Rehan):
Thank you, Hitesh. 

Let me share another critical case study: The IBM Healthcare Algorithm Bias from 2019. IBM developed an AI system to identify high-risk patients needing additional care. However, what was intended to improve healthcare ended up perpetuating racial disparities in medical treatment.

Let's analyze the ethical failures:
1. Data Bias:
   - The AI system was trained on historically biased healthcare data
   - Black patients' health needs were systematically underestimated
   - The system reinforced existing healthcare inequalities

2. Testing Inadequacies:
   - Insufficient testing across different demographic groups
   - Lack of diversity in test data
   - No systematic bias checking procedures

3. Development Team Issues:
   - Lack of diverse perspectives in the development team
   - Insufficient consultation with healthcare equity experts
   - No representation from affected communities

How could this have been prevented?
- Implementing comprehensive bias testing protocols
- Ensuring diverse representation in development teams
- Regular ethical audits of AI systems
- Consultation with affected communities
- Independent oversight of healthcare AI systems

Building on these lessons, let's examine emerging ethical challenges:

1. AI and Algorithmic Fairness:
   - Need for transparent decision-making
   - Regular bias audits
   - Diverse data representation

2. Smart Cities and Privacy:
   - Balancing surveillance with privacy
   - Protecting personal data
   - Ensuring equitable access to services

In conclusion, these case studies teach us that engineering ethics isn't just about following rules â€“ it's about actively preventing harm and promoting social good. As engineers, we must:
- Prioritize public welfare over profit
- Ensure diverse perspectives in development
- Implement robust testing and oversight
- Consider long-term societal impact
- Stand up against unethical practices

Thank you for your attention. Are there any questions?

### Timing Notes:
- Speaker 1 (Hitesh): Approximately 2 minutes
- Speaker 2 (Rehan): Approximately 2 minutes
- Total time: Approximately 4 minutes

### Presentation Tips:
1. Start strong with the quote - deliver it slowly and meaningfully
2. Use specific examples when discussing ethical violations
3. Emphasize preventive measures for each case study
4. Maintain eye contact during key points
5. Use hand gestures to emphasize important lessons
6. Practice the transitions between speakers
7. Show passion when discussing the importance of ethical engineering
